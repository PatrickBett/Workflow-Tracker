# Workflow Tracker — Mini Application Workflow Tracker

A full-stack workflow tracking application built with React and Django Ninja for managing application review workflows.

This project was developed as part of a take-home assignment for a Junior–Mid Django/React Full-Stack Developer role.

---

# Project Overview

The application allows users to:

* Create application drafts
* Submit applications for review
* Track workflow status
* Review and make decisions on applications
* Request additional information
* Approve or reject submissions

The workflow lifecycle implemented is:

```text
Draft → Submitted → Under Review → Approved / Rejected / Need More Information
```

Applications marked as **Need More Information** can be edited and resubmitted.

* Workflow actions are enforced on the backend.
* Tracking numbers are generated automatically.

* Add pagination and filtering
* Add API validation improvements
* Add audit logs/history tracking

---

## Frontend Improvements

* Improve form validation
* Add toast notifications
* Add loading and error states everywhere
* Add search and filtering
* Improve mobile responsiveness

---

## DevOps Improvements

* Dockerize the application
* Add CI/CD pipelines
* Add production environment configuration
* Deploy to AWS or Render
